# Pizza-Database
This is a group project done for a database course where we were instructed to design and implement a database for a company in our area as if we were employees.
We chose to design a database for the company Lit Pizza. 
It took around 8 - 10 hours of meetings to complete (partially due to confusion on the requirements of the project) and was a good learning experience.
The steps of the project are listed in numerical order. 
The complete sql file is complete.sql and the other .sql files are the tables, the insert statements, and the queries.
